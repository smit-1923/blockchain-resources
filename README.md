# Blockchain

<p  align="center"><img  height="150"  src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*JMQOodCGPz_Gxy5g.jpg"></p>

Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
